### Building the book

If you'd like to develop and/or build the QIC Cookbook book, you should:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)
3. (Optional) Edit the books source files located in the `./` directory
4. Run `jupyter-book clean .` to remove any existing builds
5. Run `jupyter-book build .`

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `./_build/html/`.
